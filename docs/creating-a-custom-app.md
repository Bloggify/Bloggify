Many times, you need just a starting point for your application which may or may not have a blog page.

### Initializing a Custom Application

In these cases, it is convenient to use `bloggify-tools` and choose the `Create a custom application` option.

```
? Application Template https://github.com/BloggifyTutorials/custom-app
? Website title Hello World!
? Website description Hello World from Bloggify!
? Production url http://hello-world.com
 âœ” Download the template repository
 âœ” Setting up the git repository
 âœ” Install dependencies (this may take a while)
 âœ” Create configuration file.
   ðŸŽ‰ Your app was initialized in the 'hello-world' directory.
   ðŸŽ‰ To start the app, run:
   ðŸŽ‰   cd hello-world && npm run start:dev
```
