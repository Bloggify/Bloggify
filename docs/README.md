## What it is
**Bloggify** is a web application development platform for creating websites and web applications built with Node.js.
It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started and
it allows you to write less code.

The Bloggify apps are like puzzles everything being modular. That makes code snippets and functionalities reusable across the applications.

## Features

 - _Simplicity_
   It is easy to start a Node.js application.
