Hi. My name is Ionică Bizău. I am an 18 year old student, web developer, piano player and vegetarian from Romania. I like JavaScript a lot, but sometimes I write little bash scripts or C++ applications (when needed).

I work as web developer for a Swiss company. In my free time I like to write plugins and modules that I publish on [GitHub](https://github.com/IonicaBizau), where I maintain more than 100 open source projects.

Every day I spend a little time on StackOverflow being an [active user](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1420197/ionica-bizau).

Two years ago I switched from Windows to Linux entering in the open source world.
