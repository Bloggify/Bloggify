Welcome to my first blog post. This site is powered by a CMS I work on.

The blog posts are written in Markdown.

It's very interesting how the markdown syntax is converted in HTML. For example, let's take  a look at the lists.

## Lists

The following Markdown code:

```
 - root
   - parent 1
     - child 1 1
       - child 1 1 1
       - child 1 1 2
     - child 1 2
       - child 1 2 1
     - child 1 3
   - another item
```

is converted in:

 - root
   - parent 1
     - child 1 1
       - child 1 1 1
       - child 1 1 2
     - child 1 2
       - child 1 2 1
     - child 1 3
   - another item

Try and you will love Markdown!

## Headers

Editing headers is simple:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
```

The Markdown above is converted in:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
